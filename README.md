# Cyber Delivery - Fall 2024

In Glarescape City, vibrant neon signs and illuminated skylines clash with the stark realities lurking in the shadows. The megacity pulses with life as couriers weave through perilous streets, delivering 
enigmatic packages while dodging sentient machines unleashed by a rival corporation Nebula Corp. As Zander Gunther a courier from Light Speed Delivery maneuvers through twisted alleyways and high-tech 
environments, he juggles the pressures of legacy, morality, and the desire to forge a community where loyalty outweighs corruption. Amidst the chaos of package thefts and corporate espionage, the battle 
for Glarescape City intensifies, as alliances are tested and the greater danger of criminal syndicates looms ever closer, threatening the very fabric of Zander's ambitions.
